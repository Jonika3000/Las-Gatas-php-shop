# Las-Gatas-php-shop
my first php project


This is an online hardware store named 'Las gatas'. So far, the ability to purchase goods, the profile page, as well as the basket has not been added.
The site has two parts, the first for the administrator and the second for the user.
This is how the admin part looks like, as you can see, it differs only in that it adds the ability to delete and add data about products, categories, pictures.

This is what the user account looks like.

This is what login and registration looks like. When you register, you can choose a cat avatar (there are 3 possible). 
If no avatar has been selected, the default avatar will be the first one.
